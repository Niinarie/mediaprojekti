00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
Lithium, don't want to forget how it feels without.

2
00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:15.000
Lithium, I want to stay in love with my sorrow.

3
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:23.099
Oh, but, God, I want to let it go.

4
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.050
Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone.

5
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.000
Couldn't hide the emptiness; you let it show.

6
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.099
Never wanted it to be so cold.

7
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.000
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me.

8
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.050
I can't hold on to me.

9
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:07.000
Wonder what's wrong with me.

10
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:15.050
Lithium, don't want to lock me up inside.

11
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:24.000
Lithium, don't want to forget how it feels without.

12
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:33.099
Lithium, I want to stay in love with my sorrow.
